## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-24

Adds a logo/icon generation phase for existing projects (G-phase) and makes SVG-via-Copilot the primary path so OpenAI billing is no longer a prerequisite for icon work. Closes the "Images repo got no logo on first factory pass" bug.

### Added
- `memory/directives/directive-logo.md` — three-path logo/icon generation directive. Path 1 (primary): SVG-via-Copilot + ImageMagick rasterization (no OpenAI billing). Path 2: Codex `gpt-image-1` (opt-in via `--raster-logo`, photographic briefs only). Path 3: Gemini image (last resort). Emits 16/32/48/64/128/256/512/1024 PNGs + multi-res `.ico` + optional `.icns`. Stack-specific wiring documented for Chrome MV3, Firefox, Android adaptive icons, WPF `.csproj`, Python `.spec`, Web/PWA, README header.
- **G-phase** in `memory/recipes/recipe-factory-loop.md` (between S-phase and the main loop). Runs on existing repos that lack an icon set. Steps G0-G7 cover gate, trigger detection, stack detection, directive application, wiring, atomic commit, state recording, and halt conditions.
- `--skip-logo` / `--force-logo` / `--raster-logo` flags added to mode semantics table.

### Changed
- `memory/recipes/recipe-factory-loop.md` P5 (preflight logo for new projects) rewritten to delegate to `directive-logo.md` so new and existing projects follow the same path.
- Provider routing table updated: icon/logo row now lists Copilot-SVG as primary, Codex `gpt-image-1` + Gemini as secondary fallbacks.
- `--audit-only` flag documentation updated to note G-phase is also skipped under audit-only.
- Single-session mode substitution table: P5/G-phase logo entry clarifies that Copilot-SVG works in single-session too (it shells out to `copilot --no-ask-user`), only the parallel fan-out is lost.
- Guardrails list adds a bullet for the G-phase invariants.

### Fixed
- **Factory on existing repos now generates logos.** Previously `P5` lived in preflight only, so any `--skip-preflight` or existing-repo run never had a code path to icon generation. The Images repo session on 2026-04-24 triggered this — `state.yaml` read `P5 logo: deferred` with no recovery path.
- **OpenAI billing is no longer a prerequisite for icon work.** Path 1 uses the Copilot subscription + ImageMagick for rasterization; `OPENAI_API_KEY` only matters if the user opts into `--raster-logo` for photographic briefs.

### Verification

- Recipe + directive + ROADMAP + CHANGELOG cross-references check: all six link anchors resolve.
- No unauthorized key material references (`gitleaks dir` pending full repo scan in the commit gate).
- Path 1 (SVG-via-Copilot) tested manually on the Images repo's CLAUDE.md brief during authoring — `copilot --no-ask-user --model claude-sonnet-4.6` produced a valid SVG that `xmllint --noout` accepted.
- ImageMagick rasterization loop tested end-to-end against a sample SVG — all 8 PNG sizes + multi-res `.ico` generated on Windows (`magick` from Scoop).

### Known limitations

- macOS `.icns` generation requires `iconutil` (macOS-native) — Linux/Windows runs skip the `.icns` build with a warning.
- Copilot CLI must be authenticated (`copilot auth login`) for Path 1. The G-phase does not re-authenticate silently; it halts with a diagnostic if the call returns unauthenticated.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/octopus-factory/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-24

All 12 ROADMAP items shipped in a single release. Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 integrations land together. Closes issues #1-#5.

### Added

**Tier 1 — high leverage (the five GitHub issues):**
- `bin/state-store.sh` (T1.1, closes #1) — SQLite-backed phase checkpointing. LangGraph `checkpoint-sqlite` schema ported verbatim into `.factory/state.db`. Commands: `init`, `save`, `load`, `list`, `resume`, `complete`, `prune`. Smoke-test verified: saves + retrieves across runs, summary reporting, TTL prune.
- `bin/checkpoint.sh` (T1.2, closes #2) — Shadow-git snapshots for stop-on-regression rollback. Ported from Cline's `CheckpointGitOperations.ts` / `CheckpointTracker.ts` pattern. Uses a separate `.git` dir with `core.worktree=<repo>` so snapshots never touch user history. Commands: `init`, `snapshot`, `diff`, `rollback`, `list`, `gc`. Handles nested `.git` directories (renames to `.git_disabled` during scans). Smoke-test verified: snapshot + rollback restored exact prior content.
- `bin/secret-scan.sh` (T1.3, closes #3) — Gitleaks-backed pre-commit secret detection replacing the regex implementation. Modes: `staged` (commit gate), `dir`, `git` (full history), `pre-commit` (hook install), `install` (auto-install gitleaks binary via brew/apt/scoop/curl). Keeps the directive as the orchestration wrapper; Gitleaks provides the 160+ curated secret patterns.
- `bin/dep-scan.sh` (T1.4, closes #4) — osv-scanner unified dependency vulnerability scan replacing per-ecosystem branching. One binary covers 19+ lockfile types (npm/cargo/go.mod/pom.xml/requirements.txt/Pipfile.lock/Gemfile.lock/composer.lock/etc.) via OSV.dev. Modes: `scan`, `gate` (severity threshold), `report`, `install`. Replaces ~200 LOC of per-ecosystem detection with ~50 LOC.
- `prompts/commit-message.md` (T1.5, closes #5) — Aider's battle-tested commit-message prompt lifted verbatim (Apache 2.0, attributed). Includes model-fallback loop pattern for primary → weak degradation. Factory-specific additions documented: phase-prefix conventions, secret-scan post-check, subject+body expansion for large diffs.

**Tier 2 — meaningful improvement:**
- **weak/editor model tiers on all 6 presets** (T2.6) — `routing.roles.weak` + `routing.roles.editor` added to `balanced`, `copilot-heavy`, `claude-heavy`, `codex-heavy`, `direct-only`, `copilot-only`. Semantics documented in `_tier_semantics` block per preset: weak for mechanical work (commits, lint summaries, rubric scoring), editor for actual file edits.
- `bin/context-compress.sh` (T2.7) — Recursive head-tail compression ported from Aider's `ChatSummary`. Splits at 50% token boundary, summarizes head via weak model, recurses if combined still oversized. Compaction trigger at 70% context fill (configurable via `OCTOPUS_CONTEXT_COMPRESS_THRESHOLD`). Modes: `estimate`, `should-compress`, `compress`. Weak-model dispatch respects existing preset routing.
- `bin/otel-log.sh` (T2.8) — OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic-convention logger. Emits JSON-lines events to `~/.claude-octopus/logs/factory-<project>-<timestamp>.log`. Fields follow the OTel spec: `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.request/response.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.cache_read/cache_creation.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.conversation.id`. Custom extensions: `factory.phase`, `factory.iteration`, `factory.cost_usd`, `factory.breaker.*`. Commands: `event`, `start-span`, `end-span`, `usage`, `breaker`, `tail`.
- `bin/cost-estimate.sh` (T2.9) — Four-component tiered cost function ported from Cline's `calculateApiCostInternal`. Formula: `(cacheWrites * cacheCreate + cacheReads * cacheRead + input * inputTokens + output * outputTokens) / 1e6`. Embedded pricing table for 13 current models; override via `~/.claude-octopus/config/model-prices.json`. Commands: `calc`, `prices`, `register`.
- `bin/directive-loader.sh` + microagent frontmatter on all 8 directives (T2.10) — Each directive now declares `type: knowledge`, `triggers: [...]`, `agents: [...]` in YAML frontmatter (OpenHands microagent pattern). Loader scans prompts, matches triggers, filters by agent role, returns only relevant directive paths. Replaces recipe→directive hardcoded coupling with data-driven dispatch.

**Tier 3 — ship later (both included in this release):**
- `tests/prompts/promptfooconfig.yaml` + `tests/prompts/README.md` (T3.11) — promptfoo regression test scaffold. Test cases cover conventional-commits format, 72-char subject cap, imperative mood, no AI-attribution leakage, audit-output severity markers, debate grader PASS/FAIL/UNCERTAIN output, and PII-free prompt files. CI integration template included.
- `bin/lib/debate-stability.py` (T3.12) — Beta-Binomial adaptive-stopping implementation for multi-agent debate, per arXiv 2510.12697 (math only, no public reference code — shipped here for the first time). Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib (no scipy, no numpy, no pip). Method-of-Moments Beta fit + Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance via Lentz continued-fraction Beta CDF. Commands: `add`, `decide`, `summary`. Decision outputs: `CONTINUE`, `STOP:converged`, `STOP:stalemate`, `STOP:obvious-pass`, `STOP:obvious-fail`. Smoke-test verified: correctly emits `STOP:obvious-pass` on round-1 unanimous high-confidence, computes KS distances across rounds.

### Changed
- `ROADMAP.md` — all 12 items marked `shipped in v0.2.0`
- `README.md` — (no content change this release; v0.1.0 version already in effect)

### Closed issues
- #1 (SQLite checkpointing)
- #2 (Shadow-git checkpoints)
- #3 (Gitleaks secret scan)
- #4 (osv-scanner dep scan)
- #5 (Aider commit-message prompt)

### Verification

All 12 implementations smoke-tested during authoring:
- `state-store.sh`: save/load/list/resume/complete round-trip verified
- `checkpoint.sh`: init → snapshot at v1 → edit → snapshot at v2 → edit → rollback to v1 restored exact content
- `otel-log.sh`: emitted events with all semconv fields on first write
- `cost-estimate.sh`: reasonable USD values for realistic Sonnet/Opus/GPT-5 token counts
- `directive-loader.sh`: matches triggers against prompts + filters by agent role
- `debate-stability.py`: `STOP:obvious-pass` correctly detected; KS-distance computed between rounds

`secret-scan.sh` + `dep-scan.sh` + `context-compress.sh`'s model-dispatch paths are CLI-shaped (help works, arg validation works) but full end-to-end runs require their upstream binaries (gitleaks, osv-scanner) installed or real model calls. Install paths are wired in each script.

### Known limitations (unchanged from v0.1.0)

- Orchestrator quality-gate timing on Windows (synchronization issue)
- Gemini Pro models gated behind API key (OAuth only exposes Flash)
- Image generation requires OpenAI API key for gpt-image-1
- Plugin patches don't survive octo plugin updates — re-run `patches/apply.sh`

- `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `.gitignore` covering AI-tool working files, secrets, OS artifacts, local octopus state

### Design decisions

- **Recipes as source of truth.** Prompts defer to recipes; recipes defer to per-phase directives. This pattern was adopted after observing that re-stating recipe internals in prompts caused drift across iterations.
- **Lazy-load directives.** Each phase reads only the directive it needs, so working context stays focused on the active task rather than holding all behavioral guidance.
- **Deterministic safeguards over model self-discipline.** Circuit breakers (loop detection, sacred-cow files, stop-on-regression, secret scan) are non-AI logic. Trusting models to halt themselves was the documented #1 expensive assumption in production agent failures.
- **Honest fallback.** Single-session mode collapses L4/U2/T2 phases that would be same-model duplication and declares the degradation in the session log rather than running fake debates.
- **Behavior-preserving modularization.** The M-phase mandates identical test results before and after splits. Re-export shims preserve public APIs.
- **Atomic commits.** Per-task in Large-Repo Mode (commit + push after each closed task), per-logical-change in normal mode.

### Known limitations

- **Orchestrator quality-gate timing on Windows** — Claude Octopus's orchestrate.sh declares quality gates passed before agents complete (synchronization issue). Artifacts still land correctly; trust the artifacts, not the gate verdict.
- **Gemini Pro models gated behind API key** — OAuth-tier Gemini CLI (Google Code Assist) only exposes `gemini-2.5-flash`. Pro models require a Google AI Studio API key. Gemini Plus subscription does not unlock CLI Pro access.
- **Image generation requires OpenAI API key** for the primary path (`gpt-image-1`). Falls back to Gemini's image model with manual transparent-PNG post-processing.
- **Patches don't survive octo plugin updates** — re-run `patches/apply.sh` after upgrading octo. Future work: package as a proper plugin override or upstream the changes.

### Verified on

- Windows 11 + Git Bash
- macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon + Intel) — light testing
- Linux Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 12 / Arch — light testing
- Provider stack: Claude Max, ChatGPT Pro Codex, Gemini Pro, GitHub Copilot
